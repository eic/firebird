## Visualization objects

### 2 Main canegories of objects: 

- Not changing in time (Geometry/Detector)
- Event - elements - particles, hits

## Object interaction

Anticipated user intents iterating with objects: 

1. When hovering object - show what it is?
   1. What part of detector is it? 
   2. What particle or hit is it? 
2. As it could be confusing to jump between geometry and event. Should be switches:
   3. if Geometry is affected by raycast
   4. if Event content is affected by raycast
3. When you work with the tree, you anticipate tree elements are highlighted 
   if raycasting is on and highlighting is on
4. There should be tools that utilizes the exact point locations: 
   - Show 3d coordinate of a point 
   - Show distance
